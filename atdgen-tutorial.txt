1  What is Atdgen?
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Atdgen is a tool that derives OCaml boilerplate code from type
definitions. Currently it provides support for:
  
  
   - JSON (1) serialization and deserialization. 
   - Biniou (2) serialization and deserialization. Biniou is a binary
   format extensible like JSON but more compact and faster to process. 
   - Convenience functions for creating and validating OCaml data. 
  
  

2  What are the advantages of Atdgen?
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Atdgen has a number of advantages over its predecessor json-static
which was based on Camlp4: 
  
   - produces explicit interfaces which describe what is available to
   the user (.mli files). 
   - produces readable OCaml code that can be easily reviewed (.ml
   files).  
   - produces fast code, 3x faster than json-static. 
   - runs fast, keeping build times low. 
   - same ATD definitions can be used to generate code other than OCaml.
   See for instance Atdj (3)  which generates Java classes for JSON IO.
   Auto-generating GUI widgets from type definitions is another popular
   use of annotated type definitions. The implementation of such code
   generators is facilitated by the atd (4) library. 
  
  

3  Prerequisites
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  This tutorial assumes that you are using Atdgen version 1.2.0 or
above. The following command tells you which version you are using:
<<$ atdgen -version
  1.2.0
>>
  
  A quick way of installing Atdgen and all its dependencies is via Godi.
  Alternatively, read and follow the instructions in the INSTALL file of
the source package of Atdgen.
  

4  Getting started
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  From now on we assume that Atdgen 1.2.0 or above is installed
properly.
<<$ atdgen -version
  1.2.0
>>
  
  Type definitions are placed in a .atd file (hello.atd):
<<
  type date = {
    year : int;
    month : int;
    day : int;
  }
>>
  
  Our handwritten OCaml program is hello.ml:
<<
  open Hello_t
  let () =
    let date = { year = 1970; month = 1; day = 1 } in
    print_endline (Hello_j.string_of_date date)
>>
  
  We produce OCaml code from the type definitions using atdgen:
<<$ atdgen -t hello.atd     # produces OCaml type definitions
  $ atdgen -j hello.atd     # produces OCaml code dealing with JSON
>>
  
  We now have _t and _j files produced by atdgen -t and atdgen -j
respectively:
<<$ ls
  hello.atd  hello.ml  hello_j.ml  hello_j.mli  hello_t.ml  hello_t.mli
>>
  
  We compile all .mli and .ml files:
<<$ ocamlfind ocamlc -c hello_t.mli -package atdgen
  $ ocamlfind ocamlc -c hello_j.mli -package atdgen
  $ ocamlfind ocamlopt -c hello_t.ml -package atdgen
  $ ocamlfind ocamlopt -c hello_j.ml -package atdgen
  $ ocamlfind ocamlopt -c hello.ml -package atdgen
  $ ocamlfind ocamlopt -o hello hello_t.cmx hello_j.cmx hello.cmx \
      -package atdgen -linkpkg
>>
  
  And finally we run our hello program:
<<$ ./hello
  {"year":1970,"month":1,"day":1}
>>

5  Inspecting and pretty-printing JSON
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Input JSON data:
<<$ cat single.json 
  [1234,"abcde",{"start_date":{"year":1970,"month":1,"day":1}, 
  "end_date":{"year":1980,"month":1,"day":1}}]
>>
  
  Pretty-printed JSON can be produced with the ydump command:
<<$ ydump single.json 
  [
    1234,
    "abcde",
    {
      "start_date": { "year": 1970, "month": 1, "day": 1 },
      "end_date": { "year": 1980, "month": 1, "day": 1 }
    }
  ]
>>
  
  Multiple JSON objects separated by whitespace, typically one JSON
object per line, can also be pretty-printed with ydump. Input:
<<$ cat stream.json 
  [1234,"abcde",{"start_date":{"year":1970,"month":1,"day":1}, 
  "end_date":{"year":1980,"month":1,"day":1}}]
  [1,"a",{}]
>>
  
  In this case the -s option is required:
<<$ ydump -s stream.json 
  [
    1234,
    "abcde",
    {
      "start_date": { "year": 1970, "month": 1, "day": 1 },
      "end_date": { "year": 1980, "month": 1, "day": 1 }
    }
  ]
  [ 1, "a", {} ]
>>
  
  From an OCaml program, pretty-printing can be done with
Yojson.Safe.prettify  which has the following signature:
<<
  val prettify : string -> string
>>
  
  We wrote a tiny program that simply calls the prettify function on 
some predefined JSON data (file prettify.ml):
<<
  let json =
  "[1234,\"abcde\",{\"start_date\":{\"year\":1970,\"month\":1,\"day\":1}
, 
  \"end_date\":{\"year\":1980,\"month\":1,\"day\":1}}]"
  
  let () = print_endline (Yojson.Safe.prettify json)
>>
  
  We now compile and run prettify.ml:
<<$ ocamlfind ocamlopt -o prettify prettify.ml -package atdgen -linkpkg
  $ ./prettify
  [
    1234,
    "abcde",
    {
      "start_date": { "year": 1970, "month": 1, "day": 1 },
      "end_date": { "year": 1980, "month": 1, "day": 1 }
    }
  ]
>>

6  Inspecting biniou data
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Biniou is a binary format that can be displayed as text using a
generic command called bdump. The only practical difficulty is to
recover the original field names and variant names which are stored as
31-bit hashes. Unhashing them is done by consulting a dictionary (list
of words) maintained by the user.
  Let's first produce a sample data file tree.dat containing the biniou
representation of a binary tree. In the same program we will also
demonstrate how to render biniou data into text from an OCaml program.
  Here is the ATD file defining our tree type (file tree.atd):
<<
  type tree =
      [ Empty
      | Node of (tree * int * tree) ]
>>
  
  This is our OCaml program (file tree.ml):
<<
  open Printf
  
  (* sample value *)
  let tree : Tree_t.tree =
    `Node (
      `Node (`Empty, 1, `Empty),
      2,
      `Node (
        `Node (`Empty, 3, `Empty),
        4,
        `Node (`Empty, 5, `Empty)
      )
    )
  
  let () =
    (* write sample value to file *)
    let fname = "tree.dat" in
    Ag_util.Biniou.to_file Tree_b.write_tree fname tree;
  
    (* write sample value to string *)
    let s = Tree_b.string_of_tree tree in
    printf "raw value (saved as %s):\n%S\n" fname s;
    printf "length: %i\n" (String.length s);
  
    printf "pretty-printed value (without dictionary):\n";
    print_endline (Bi_io.view s);
  
    printf "pretty-printed value (with dictionary):\n";
    let unhash = Bi_io.make_unhash ["Empty"; "Node"; "foo"; "bar" ] in
    print_endline (Bi_io.view ~unhash s)
>>
  
  Compilation:
<<$ atdgen -t tree.atd
  $ atdgen -b tree.atd
  $ ocamlfind ocamlopt -o tree \
      tree_t.mli tree_t.ml tree_b.mli tree_b.ml tree.ml \
      -package atdgen -linkpkg
>>
  
  Running the program:
<<$ ./tree
  raw value (saved as tree.dat):
  "\023\179\2276\"\020\003\023\179\2276\"\020\003\023\003\007\170m\017\0
02\023\003\007\170m\017\004\023\179\2276\"\020\003\023\179\2276\"\020\00
3\023\003\007\170m\017\006\023\003\007\170m\017\b\023\179\2276\"\020\003
\023\003\007\170m\017\n\023\003\007\170m"
  length: 75
  pretty-printed value (without dictionary):
  <#33e33622:
     (<#33e33622: (<#0307aa6d>, 1, <#0307aa6d>)>,
      2,
      <#33e33622:
         (<#33e33622: (<#0307aa6d>, 3, <#0307aa6d>)>,
          4,
          <#33e33622: (<#0307aa6d>, 5, <#0307aa6d>)>)>)>
  pretty-printed value (with dictionary):
  <"Node":
     (<"Node": (<"Empty">, 1, <"Empty">)>,
      2,
      <"Node":
         (<"Node": (<"Empty">, 3, <"Empty">)>,
          4,
          <"Node": (<"Empty">, 5, <"Empty">)>)>)>
>>
  
  Now let's see how to pretty-print any biniou data from the command
line. Our sample data are now in file tree.dat:
<<$ ls -l tree.dat
  -rw-r--r-- 1 martin martin 75 Apr 17 01:46 tree.dat
>>
  
  We use the command bdump to render our sample biniou data as text:
<<$ bdump tree.dat
  <#33e33622:
     (<#33e33622: (<#0307aa6d>, 1, <#0307aa6d>)>,
      2,
      <#33e33622:
         (<#33e33622: (<#0307aa6d>, 3, <#0307aa6d>)>,
          4,
          <#33e33622: (<#0307aa6d>, 5, <#0307aa6d>)>)>)>
>>
  
  We got hashes for the variant names Empty and Node. Let's add them to
the dictionary:
<<$ bdump -w Empty,Node tree.dat
  <"Node":
     (<"Node": (<"Empty">, 1, <"Empty">)>,
      2,
      <"Node":
         (<"Node": (<"Empty">, 3, <"Empty">)>,
          4,
          <"Node": (<"Empty">, 5, <"Empty">)>)>)>
>>
  
  bdump remembers the dictionary so we don't have to pass the  -w option
anymore (for this user on this machine). The following now works:
<<$ bdump tree.dat
  <"Node":
     (<"Node": (<"Empty">, 1, <"Empty">)>,
      2,
      <"Node":
         (<"Node": (<"Empty">, 3, <"Empty">)>,
          4,
          <"Node": (<"Empty">, 5, <"Empty">)>)>)>
>>

7  Optional fields and default values
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Although OCaml records do not support optional fields, both the JSON
and biniou formats make it possible to omit certain fields on a
per-record basis.
  For example the JSON record { "x": 0, "y": 0 } can be more compactly
written as {} if the reader knows the default values for the missing
fields x and y. Here is the corresponding type definition:
<<
  type vector_v1 = { ~x: int; ~y: int }
>>
  
  ~x means that field x supports a default value. Since we do not 
specify the default value ourselves, the built-in default is used, which
is 0.
  If we want the default to be something else than 0, we just have to
specify it as follows:
<<
  type vector_v2 = {
    ~x <ocaml default="1">: int; (* default x is 1 *)
    ~y: int;                     (* default y is 0 *)
  }
>>
  
  It is also possible to specify optional fields without a default
value. For example, let's add an optional z field:
<<
  type vector_v3 = {
    ~x: int;
    ~y: int;
    ?z: int option;
  }
>>
  
  The following two examples are valid JSON representations of data of
type vector_v3:
<<{ "x": 2, "y": 2, "z": 3 }  // OCaml: { x = 2; y = 2; z = Some 3 }
>>
  
<<{ "x": 2, "y": 2 }          // OCaml: { x = 2; y = 2; z = None }
>>
  
  For a variety of good reasons JSON's null value may not be used to
indicate that a field is undefined. Therefore the following JSON data
cannot be read as a record of type vector_v3:
<<{ "x": 2, "y": 2, "z": null }  // invalid value for field z
>>
  
  Note also the difference between ?z: int option and ~z: int option:
<<
  type vector_v4 = {
    ~x: int;
    ~y: int;
    ~z: int option;  (* no unwrapping of the JSON field value! *)
  }
>>
  
  Here are valid values of type vector_v4, showing that it is usually
not what is intended:
<<{ "x": 2, "y": 2, "z": [ "Some", 3 ] }
>>
  
<<{ "x": 2, "y": 2, "z": "None" }
>>
  
<<{ "x": 2, "y": 2 }
>>
  
  

8  Smooth protocol upgrades
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Problem: you have a production system that uses a specific JSON or
biniou format. It may be data files or a client-server pair. You now
want to add a field to a record type or to add a case to a variant type.
  Both JSON and biniou allow extra record fields. If the consumer does
not know how to deal with the extra field, the default behavior is to
happily ignore it.
  

8.1  Adding or removing an optional record field
================================================
  
<<
  type t = {
    x: int;
    y: int;
  }
>>
  
  Same .atd source file, edited:
<<
  type t = {
    x: int;
    y: int;
    ~z: int; (* new field *)
  }
>>
  
  
  
   - Upgrade producers and consumers in any order 
   - Converting old data is not required nor useful 
  
  

8.2  Adding a required record field
===================================
  
<<
  type t = {
    x: int;
    y: int;
  }
>>
  
  Same .atd source file, edited:
<<
  type t = {
    x: int;
    y: int;
    z: int; (* new field *)
  }
>>
  
  
  
   - Upgrade all producers before the consumers 
   - Converting old data requires special-purpose hand-written code 
  
  

8.3  Removing a required record field
=====================================
  
  
  
   - Upgrade all consumers before the producers 
   - Converting old data is not required but may save some storage space
   (just read and re-write each record using the new type) 
  
  

8.4  Adding a variant case
==========================
  
<<
  type t = [ A | B ]
>>
  
  Same .atd source file, edited:
<<
  type t = [ A | B | C ]
>>
  
  
  
   - Upgrade all consumers before the producers 
   - Converting old data is not required and would have no effect 
  
  

8.5  Removing a variant case
============================
  
  
  
   - Upgrade all producers before the consumers 
   - Converting old data requires special-purpose hand-written code 
  
  

8.6  Avoiding future problems
=============================
  
  
  
   - In doubt, use records rather than tuples because it makes it
   possible to add or remove any field or to reorder them. 
   - Do not hesitate to create variant types with only one case or
   records with only one field if you think they might be extended
   later. 
  
  

9  Data validation
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Atdgen can be used to produce data validators for all types defined 
in an ATD file, based on user-given validators specified only for
certain types. A simple example is:
<<
  type t = string <ocaml validator="fun s -> String.length s >= 8">
option
>>
  
  atdgen -v will produce something equivalent to the following
implementation: 
<<
  let validate_t x =
    match x with
        None -> true
      | Some x -> (fun s -> String.length s >= 8) x
>>
  
  Let's now consider a more realistic example with complex validators
defined in a separate .ml file. We created the following 3 source files:
  
  
   - resume.atd: contains the type definitions with annotations 
   - resume_util.ml: contains our handwritten validators 
   - resume.ml: is our main program that creates data and calls the
   validators  
  
  In terms of OCaml modules we have:
  
  
   - Resume_t: produced by atdgen -t resume.atd,  provides OCaml type
   definitions 
   - Resume_util: depends on Resume_t, provides validators mentioned in
   resume.atd 
   - Resume_v: produced by atdgen -v resume.atd, depends on Resume_util,
   provides a validator for each type 
   - Resume: depends on Resume_v, uses the validators 
  
  Type definitions are placed in resume.atd:
<<
  type text = string <ocaml validator="Resume_util.validate_some_text">
  
  type date = {
    year : int;
    month : int;
    day : int;
  } <ocaml validator="Resume_util.validate_date">
  
  type job = {
    company : text;
    title : text;
    start_date : date;
    ?end_date : date option;
  } <ocaml validator="Resume_util.validate_job">
  
  type work_experience = job list
>>
  
  resume_util.ml contains our handwritten validators:
<<
  open Resume_t
  
  let ascii_printable c =
    let n = Char.code c in
    n >= 32 && n <= 127
  
  (*
    Check that string is not empty and contains only ASCII printable
    characters (for the sake of the example; we use UTF-8 these days)
  *)
  let validate_some_text s =
    s <> "" &&
      try
        String.iter (fun c -> if not (ascii_printable c) then raise
Exit) s;
        true
      with Exit ->
        false
  
  (*
    Check that the combination of year, month and day exists in the 
    Gregorian calendar.
  *)
  let validate_date x =
    let y = x.year in
    let m = x.month in
    let d = x.day in
    m >= 1 && m <= 12 && d >= 1 &&
    (let dmax =
       match m with
           2 ->
             if y mod 4 = 0 && not (y mod 100 = 0) || y mod 400 = 0 then
29
             else 28
         | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 8 | 10 | 12 -> 31
         | _ -> 30
     in
     d <= dmax)
  
  (* Compare dates chronologically *)
  let compare_date a b =
    let c = compare a.year b.year in
    if c <> 0 then c
    else
      let c = compare a.month b.month in
      if c <> 0 then c
      else compare a.day b.day
  
  (* Check that the end_date, when defined, is not earlier than the
start_date *)
  let validate_job x =
    match x.end_date with
        None -> true
      | Some end_date ->
          compare_date x.start_date end_date <= 0
>>
  
  resume.ml uses the validate_work_experience function provided by the
Resume_v module:
<<
  let check_experience x =
    let is_valid = Resume_v.validate_work_experience x in
    Printf.printf "%s:\n%s\n"
      (if is_valid then "VALID" else "INVALID")
      (Yojson.Safe.prettify (Resume_j.string_of_work_experience x))
  
  let () =
    (* one valid date *)
    let valid = { Resume_t.year = 2000; month = 2; day = 29 } in
    (* one invalid date *)
    let invalid = { Resume_t.year = 1900; month = 0; day = 0 } in
    (* two more valid dates, created with Resume_v.create_date *)
    let date1 = { Resume_t.year = 2005; month = 8; day = 1 } in
    let date2 = { Resume_t.year = 2006; month = 3; day = 22 } in
  
    let job = {
      Resume_t.company = "Acme Corp.";
      title = "Tester";
      start_date = date1;
      end_date = Some date2;
    }
    in
    let valid_job = { job with Resume_t.start_date = valid } in
    let invalid_job = { job with Resume_t.end_date = Some invalid } in
    let valid_experience = [ job; valid_job ] in
    let invalid_experience = [ job; invalid_job ] in
    check_experience valid_experience;
    check_experience invalid_experience
>>
  
  Output:
<<VALID:
  [
    {

10  Modularity: referring to type definitions from another ATD file
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  It is possible to define types that depend on types defined in other
.atd files. The example below is self-explanatory.
  part1.atd:
<<
  type t = { x : int; y : int }
>>
  
  part2.atd:
<<
  type t1 <ocaml from="Part1" t="t"> = abstract
      (*
        Imports type t defined in file part1.atd.
        The local name is t1. Because the local name (t1) is different
from the
        original name (t), we must specify the original name using t=.
      *)
  
  type t2 = t1 list
>>
  
  part3.atd:
<<
  type t2 <ocaml from="Part2"> = abstract
  
  type t3 = {
    name : string;
    ?data : t2 option;
  }
>>
  
  main.ml:
<<
  let v = {
    Part3_t.name = "foo";
    data = Some [
      { Part1_t.x = 1; y = 2 };
      { Part1_t.x = 3; y = 4 };
    ]
  }
  
  let () =
    Ag_util.Json.to_channel Part3_j.write_t3 stdout v;
    print_newline ()
>>
  
  Output:
<<{"name":"foo","data":[{"x":1,"y":2},{"x":3,"y":4}]}

11  Managing JSON configuration files
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  JSON makes a good format for configuration files because it is
human-readable, easy to modify programmatically and widespread. Here is
an example of how to use atdgen to manage config files.
  
  
   - Specifying defaults is done in the .atd file. See section 7 for
   details on how to do that. 
   - Auto-generating a template config file with default values: a
   sample value in the OCaml world needs to be created but only fields
   without default need to be specified. 
   - Describing the format is achieved by embedding the .atd type
   definitions in the OCaml program and printing it out on request. 
   - Loading a config file and reporting illegal fields is achieved
   using the JSON deserializers produced by atdgen -j. Option
   -j-strict-fields ensures the misspelled field names are not ignored
   but reported as errors. 
   - Reindenting a config file is achieved by the pretty-printing
   function Yojson.Safe.prettify that takes a JSON string and returns an
   equivalent JSON string. 
   - Showing implicit (default) settings is achieved by passing the
   -j-defaults option to atdgen. The OCaml config data is then
   serialized into JSON containing all fields, including those whose
   value is the default. 
  
  This is our demo.sh script that builds and runs our example program
called config: 
<<#! /bin/sh -e
  
  set -x
  
  # Embed the contents of the .atd file into our OCaml program
  echo 'let contents = "\' > config_atd.ml
  sed -e 's/\([\\"]\)/\\\1/g' config.atd >> config_atd.ml
  echo '"' >> config_atd.ml
  
  # Derive OCaml type definitions from .atd file
  atdgen -t config.atd
  
  # Derive JSON-related functions from .atd file
  atdgen -j -j-defaults -j-strict-fields config.atd
  
  # Derive validator from .atd file
  atdgen -v config.atd
  
  # Compile the OCaml program
  ocamlfind ocamlopt -o config \
    config_t.mli config_t.ml config_j.mli config_j.ml config_v.mli
config_v.ml \
    config_atd.ml config.ml -package atdgen -linkpkg
  
  # Output a sample config
  ./config -template
  
  # Print the original type definitions
  ./config -format
  
  # Fail to validate an invalid config file
  ./config -validate bad-config1.json || :
  
  # Validate, inject missing defaults and pretty-print
  ./config -validate sample-config.json
>>
  
  The example uses the following type definitions: 
<<type config = {
    title : string;
    ?description : string option;
    ~timeout <ocaml default="10"> : int;
    ~credentials : param list;
  }
  
  type param = {
    name : string;
    key : string;
  }
>>
  
  This is the hand-written OCaml program. It can be used as a start
point for a real-world program using a JSON config file: 
<<open Printf
  
  let param_template =
    (* Sample item used to populate the template config file *)
    {
      Config_v.name = "foo";
      key = "0123456789abcdef"
    }
  
  let config_template =
    (*
      Records can be conveniently created using functions generated by
      "atdgen -v".
      Here we use Config_v.create_config to create a record of type
      Config_t.config. The big advantage over creating the record 
      directly using the record notation {...} is that we don't have to
      specify default values (such as timeout in this example).
    *)
    Config_v.create_config ~title:"" ~credentials: [param_template] ()
  
  let make_json_template () =
    (* Thanks to the -j-defaults flag passed to atdgen, even default
       fields will be printed out *)
    let compact_json = Config_j.string_of_config config_template in
    Yojson.Safe.prettify compact_json
  
  let print_template () =
    print_endline (make_json_template ())
  
  let print_format () =
    print_string Config_atd.contents
  
  let validate fname =
    let x =
      try
        (* Read config data structure from JSON file *)
        Ag_util.Json.from_file Config_j.read_config fname
      with e ->
        (* Print decent error message and exit *)
        let msg =
          match e with
              Failure s
            | Yojson.Json_error s -> s
            | e -> Printexc.to_string e
        in
        eprintf "Error: %s\n%!" msg;
        exit 1
    in
    (* Convert config to compact JSON and pretty-print it.
       ~std:true means that the output will not use extended syntax for
       variants and tuples but only standard JSON. *)
    let json = Yojson.Safe.prettify ~std:true (Config_j.string_of_config
x) in
    print_endline json
  
  type action = Template | Format | Validate of string
  
  let main () =
    let action = ref Template in
    let options = [
      "-template", Arg.Unit (fun () -> action := Template),
      "

      "-validate", Arg.String (fun s -> action := Validate s),
      "<CONFIG FILE>

            and prints the config nicely to stdout";
    ]
    in
    let usage_msg = sprintf "\

12  Integration with ocamldoc
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Ocamldoc is a tool that comes with the core OCaml distribution. It
uses comments within (** and *) to produce hyperlinked documentation
(HTML) of module signatures.
  Atdgen can produce .mli files with comments in the syntax supported by
 ocamldoc but regular ATD comments within (* and *) are always discarded
 by Atdgen. Instead, <doc text="..."> must be used and placed after the 
element they describe. The contents of the text field must be
UTF8-encoded.
<<
  type point = {
    x : float;
    y : float;
    ~z
      <doc text="Optional depth, its default value is {{0.0}}.">
      : float;
  }
    <doc text="Point with optional 3rd dimension.
  
  OCaml example:
  {{{
  let p =
    { x = 0.5; y = 1.0; z = 0. } 
  }}}
  ">
>>
  
  is converted into the following .mli file with ocamldoc-compatible
comments: 
<<
  (**
    Point with optional 3rd dimension.
    
    OCaml example:
    
  {v
  let p =
    \{ x = 0.5; y = 1.0; z = 0. \} 
  v}
  *)
  type point = {
    x: float;
    y: float;
    z: float (** Optional depth, its default value is [0.0]. *)
  }
>>
  
  The only two forms of markup supported by <doc text="..."> are {{ ...
}}  for inline code and {{{ ... }}} for a block of preformatted code. 
  

13  Integration with build systems
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  

13.0.1  OMake
-------------
  
  We provide an Atdgen plugin (5) for OMake (6). It allows to simplify
the compilation rules to a minimum.
  The plugin consists of a self-documented file to copy into a project's
root. The following is a sample OMakefile for a project using JSON and
five source files (foo.atd, foo.ml, bar.atd, bar.ml and main.ml):
<<include Atdgen
    # requires file Atdgen.om
  
  OCAMLFILES = foo_t foo_j foo bar_t bar_j bar main
    # correspond to the OCaml modules we want to build
  
  Atdgen(foo bar, -j-std)
  OCamlProgram(foobar, $(OCAMLFILES))
  
  .DEFAULT: foobar.opt
  
  .PHONY: clean
  clean:
    rm -f *.cm[ioxa] *.cmx[as] *.[oa] *.opt *.run *~
    rm -f $(ATDGEN_OUTFILES)
>>
  
  Running omake builds the native code executable foobar.opt.
  omake clean removes all the products of compilation including the .mli
and .ml produced by atdgen.
  

13.0.2  GNU Make
----------------
  
  We provide  Atdgen.mk (7), a generic makefile that defines the 
dependencies and rules for generating OCaml .mli and .ml files from .atd
files containing type definitions. The Atdgen.mk file contains its own
documentation.
  Here is a sample Makefile that takes advantage of OCamlMakefile (8): 
<<.PHONY: default
  default: opt
  
  ATDGEN_SOURCES = foo.atd bar.atd
  ATDGEN_FLAGS = -j-std
  include Atdgen.mk
  
  SOURCES = \
    foo_t.mli foo_t.ml foo_j.mli foo_j.ml \
    bar_t.mli bar_t.ml bar_j.mli bar_j.ml \
    hello.ml
  RESULT = hello
  PACKS = atdgen
  # "include OCamlMakefile" must come after defs for SOURCES, RESULT,
PACKS, etc.
  include OCamlMakefile
  
  .PHONY: sources opt all
  sources: $(SOURCES)
  opt: sources
          $(MAKE) native-code
  all: sources
          $(MAKE) byte-code
>>
  
  make alone builds a native code executable from source files foo.atd,
bar.atd and hello.ml. make clean removes generated files. make all
builds a bytecode executable. In addition to native-code, byte-code and
clean, OCamlMakefile provides a number of other targets and options
which are documented in OCamlMakefile's README.
